This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with an assessment form and server-side action.

## Getting Started

Make sure you can install dependencies, run tests, run the development server and make edits:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Try making edits to  `app/page.tsx`, `app/assessment/page.tsx`, or `app/actions/assessment.ts`. The page auto-updates as you save changes.
